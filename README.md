# Netflix_Clone

This web app has similar user interface like **NETFLIX**. The main reason behind building this web app is to implement a tries data structure to give autocomple (suggestion) feature for user & in this web app we can filter movies by searching.(uses searching algorithm).

**NOTE:**
- If you want to see the netflix sliders and the similar ui like netflix app & want to build your own extended web app this project would be a good start.
- in this app i have added only just 2 or 3 minute videos of every movies/webseries cause i dont have cloud storage access to host every 2 or 3 GB of single video. 

**live preview of this project** https://nmovies.netlify.app/htmls/browse.htm
